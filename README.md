# MakeArchiveDb
Makes archive of 1C: Enterprise database using PowerShell.

Database properties are stored in an external file.
A script can make an archive for multiple databases. 
Just call the Main method and pass the content that you want (Get-Content object).

The Get-Content cmdlet gets the content of the item at the location specified by the path. For files, the content is read one line at a time and returns a collection of objects, each of which represents a line of content.
